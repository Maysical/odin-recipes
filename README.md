# odin-recipes
Small recipe website made for a project for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes).

This is a course I'm following in my pursuit to become a better developer and so I can be better prepared for the next semester.

## Reflection
While I haven't necessarily learnt a lot of new things, it was definitely a pretty helpful refresher.
